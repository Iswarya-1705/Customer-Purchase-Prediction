# Customer Purchase Prediction (Logistic Regression)

## 🎯 Why this project?
I learned about **Logistic Regression** in my Machine Learning subject from my HOD mam.  
To practice the concept, I built this project where I predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on **Age** and **Salary**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict if a customer will buy (1) or not (0) using Age and Salary.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  

## 🚀 Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing (train-test split, feature scaling)  
2. Logistic Regression Model Training  
3. Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy)  
4. Prediction for new customer input  

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~85–90%  
- Example:
-  Age = 35, Salary = 60,000 → Customer will Buy ✅

   Age = 20, Salary = 25,000 → Customer won’t Buy ❌

## 🔗 About This Project
This project is inspired by my ML class (Logistic Regression).

Taught by:

The Dr. P. Vasuki (Head of the Department IT). 

I wanted to put theory into practice and build a real project.
